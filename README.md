# Taxi Trip Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts taxi trip prices based on trip distance, duration, and fare parameters using a K-Nearest Neighbors regression model.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Features
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- KNN regression model training
- Model evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R² score

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the script:
   python taxi_price_prediction.py

## Results
The model was evaluated using RMSE, MSE, and R² score to measure prediction accuracy.
